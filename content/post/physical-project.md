# Create physical project with modern tools hasn't change that much
Almost 10 years ago, when I wanted to create with CnC and other motion systems, the Go To desktop tool was Aspire or VCarve.

I tried many, many other tools : Carbide create, Inkscape, Kiri:Moto, Fusion 360 and, somehow, I'm back with Aspire. 

Not that Aspire is all I ever wanted, but I think you can stumble your way to understanding the software, as opposed to Fusion 360.

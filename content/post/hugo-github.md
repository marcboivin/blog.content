Chasing the trend of trying to recapture what it was like to publish and do dev in the early 2000's I'm giving Hugo a try.

GitHub pages seems to be the perfect Geocities replacement and thus, this lives here. 

Right off the bat, things are different. Back in the days, you could conceivably open Notepad, or FrontPage and start building a page. 

Building in Hugo is not easier or different from any other moderns stack I know. Publishing seems a lot easier, mainly because there is no backend to worry about. Backend in the sense of a "dynamic backend" where a SQL database of some sort is involved.

So, took me about 5 hours of researching and testing things to get to place where I can publish. Didn't hate the process, didn't love it either. 

Being able to write in VS Code or Notepad if I so choose is a nice touch. Being built on top of git is another one.

My current theme, Ed, is supposed to be geared towards publishing. Since I don't intend to share much code here, I'm giving it a try. 

Let's see if this stack makes me more likely to publish more and maybe even have something to say.
